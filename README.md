# Quasi-Recurrent Neural Network (QRNN) for Tensorflow

This repository contains a Tensorflow implementation of [Salesforce Research](https://einstein.ai/)'s [Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01576) paper. It supports batch-major or time-major inputs in single or double precision.

From the authors:
> The QRNN provides similar accuracy to the LSTM but can be betwen 2 and 17 times faster than the highly optimized NVIDIA cuDNN LSTM implementation depending on the use case.

To install, simply run:

`pip3 install tensorflow_qrnn`

The original PyTorch implementation of the QRNN can be found [here](https://github.com/salesforce/pytorch-qrnn).

### Requirements

- Tensorflow 1.4 (`pip install tensorflow` or `pip install tensorflow-gpu`)
- GCC
- CUDA (optional, needed for GPU support)

### Testing

```
python qrnn/test_fo_pool.py
```

### TODOs

- PyPi registration
